Hello,
To get the programme of workshops and tutorials started quickly, it is
important everyone has the tools installed and ready on their computers.
The tools we'll be using will be the language Python and the Jupyter
Notebook. Don't worry if you've not used these before, we'll cover them
during the first morning of the workshop, but it is important you've
installed them and checked they work before the start of the workshop.

Python is a programming language with a wide array of powerful libraries
for data analysis. The Jupyter Notebook is a way of interactively
working your data using python. We'll have a look at this later.



===Step 1: Installation===
First we need to get this installed. I recommend you install the
anaconda distribution, this contains everything you'll need. It is
available for windows, linux and apple. Please make sure you download
the python 2.7 version (NOT python 3.4).

http://continuum.io/downloads

It's quite big. If you have trouble downloading it, maybe find other
people at your institution who are also downloading it, so you only need
to download it once.

The installation should be quite straightforward.

If you have any trouble, please email me:

-----------
A note for those with python installed already:
Some of you might have python installed already. Installing anaconda
will probably still be the easiest way to get it working quickly.
However, if you want to install the tools separately, you'll need to
install:
- Jupyter, follow the instructions here: http://ipython.org/install.html
- The following packages:
1) numpy
2) scipy
3) matplotlib
4) PIL
5) scikit-learn
These you can install using pip, in linux:
sudo pip install numpy
sudo pip install scipy
sudo pip install matplotlib
sudo pip install PIL --allow-unverified PIL --allow-all-external
sudo pip install scikit-learn
In windows similar pip commands can be used (without the sudo).

===Step 2:Trying it out===
Once it's all installed, you need to start Jupyter (also called an
ipython notebook).

In windows you should be able to find a launcher for IPython Notebook
under Anaconda in the Start Menu.

In linux or OS X, open a terminal window, then type:
    ipython notebook

A browser window should pop up with the notebook inside (you might have
to click on a link in the terminal if that doesn't happen).

Create a new notebook by (at the top right of the screen) clicking on
New, then on Python 2 (see pic1.png). This should create a new notebook
(pic2.png).

In the box, by "In []:", try typing:

print("Hello World")

Then press Shift-enter. This will run it (you can also press the little
> arrow in the toolbar).

Your notebook should look like it does in pic2.png. If it doesn't check
the cell is of type "Code" (see the drop down menu in the toolbar).




===Step 3:Trying more stuff===
You're now ready for the workshop. To get a bit of a head start, why not
try these examples...

Try copying this code into a blank cell in the notebook:

-----
print "This is the Jupyter notebook"
print "It provides a platform for:"
words = ['Open', 'Data', 'Science']
from random import shuffle
for i in range(3):
    shuffle(words)
    print ' '.join(words)
-----

(press Shift-enter to run it)

What does it do? How does it work?



You can try plotting things too:

-----
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt      #this imports the matplotlib
plotting library we need
%matplotlib inline      #this makes it appear inside the notebook
import numpy as np      #numpy is a mathematics toolkit
x = np.linspace(0,16,100)
y = np.sin(x)
plt.plot(x,y)               #plotting the result
-----

This should plot a sine-wave.




Finally, to let us know you've got it all working, try this code (in the
next cell down):

-----
import urllib
my_email = 'put.your@email.address.here"
urllib.urlretrieve('http://ml.sheffield.ac.uk/~msmith/cgi-bin/workshop.cgi?email='+my_email)
-----

This uses a library, called 'urllib' to send a message to us to let us
know you've got it working!

Thanks!



If you get stuck, or have any questions, let me know.
